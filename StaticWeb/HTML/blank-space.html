            <h1>LYRICS</h1>
           <p>Nice to meet you, where you been?<br/>
            I could show you incredible things<br/>
            Magic, madness, heaven, sin<br/>
            Saw you there and I thought<br/>
            "Oh, my God, look at that face"<br/>
            "You look like my next mistake"<br/>
            Love's a game, wanna play? Ay<br/>
            New money, suit and tie<br/>
            I can read you like a magazine<br/>
            Ain't it funny? Rumors fly<br/>
            And I know you heard about me<br/>
            So hey, let's be friends<br/>
            I'm dying to see how this one ends<br/>
            Grab your passport and my hand<br/>
            I can make the bad guys good for a weekend<br/>
            So it's gonna be forever<br/>
            Or it's gonna go down in flames<br/>
            You can tell me when it's over, mmh<br/>
            If the high was worth the pain<br/>
            Got a long list of ex-lovers<br/>
            They'll tell you I'm insane<br/>
            'Cause you know I love the players<br/>
            And you love the game<br/>
            'Cause we're young and we're reckless<br/>
            We'll take this way too far<br/>
            It'll leave you breathless<br/>
            Or with a nasty scar<br/>
            Got a long list of ex-lovers<br/>
            They'll tell you I'm insane<br/>
            But I've got a blank space, baby<br/>
            And I'll write your name<br/>
            Cherry lips, crystal skies<br/>
            I could show you incredible things<br/>
            Stolen kisses, pretty lies<br/>
            You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen<br/>
            Find out what you want<br/>
            Be that girl for a month<br/>
            Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no<br/>
            Screaming, crying, perfect storms<br/>
            I can make all the tables turn<br/>
            Rose garden filled with thorns<br/>
            Keep you second guessing like<br/>
            "Oh, my God, who is she?"<br/>
            I get drunk on jealousy<br/>
            But you'll come back each time you leave<br/>
            'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream<br/>
            So it's gonna be forever<br/>
            Or it's gonna go down in flames<br/>
            You can tell me when it's over<br/>
            If the high was worth the pain<br/>
            Got a long list of ex-lovers<br/>
            They'll tell you I'm insane<br/>

            And I'll write your name<br/>
            Boys only want love if it's torture<br/>
            Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya<br/>

            but she’s so clingy that they leave and she cries, and then she gets another one in her web and she <br/>
            traps them and locks them in her mansion and then she’s crying in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls."
