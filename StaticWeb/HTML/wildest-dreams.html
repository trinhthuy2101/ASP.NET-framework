            <h1>LYRICS</h1>
           <p>He said, "Let's get out of this town<br/>
            Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"<br/>
            I thought heaven can't help me now<br/>
            Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down<br/>
            He's so tall and handsome as hell<br/>
            He's so bad but he does it so well<br/>
            I can see the end as it begins<br/>
            My one condition is<br/>
            Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress<br/>
            Staring at the sunset, babe<br/>
            Red lips and rosy cheeks<br/>
            Say you'll see me again<br/>
            Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ha<br/>
            Wildest dreams, ah-ha<br/>
            I said, "No one has to know what we do"<br/>
            His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room<br/>
            And his voice is a familiar sound<br/>
            Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now<br/>
            He's so tall and handsome as hell<br/>
            He's so bad but he does it so well<br/>
            And when we've had our very last kiss<br/>
            My last request is<br/>
            Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress<br/>
            Staring at the sunset, babe<br/>
            Red lips and rosy cheeks<br/>
            Say you'll see me again<br/>
            Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ha<br/>
            Wildest dreams, ah-ha<br/>
            You'll see me in hindsight<br/>
            Tangled up with you all night<br/>
            Burnin' it down<br/>
            Someday when you leave me<br/>
            I bet these memories<br/>
            Follow you around<br/>
            You'll see me in hindsight<br/>
            Tangled up with you all night<br/>
            Burnin' it down<br/>
            Someday when you leave me<br/>
            I bet these memories<br/>
            Follow you around<br/>
            Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress<br/>
            Staring at the sunset, babe<br/>
            Red lips and rosy cheeks<br/>
            Say you'll see me again<br/>
            Even if it's just pretend<br/>
            Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress<br/>
            Staring at the sunset, babe<br/>
            Red lips and rosy cheeks<br/>
            Say you'll see me again<br/>
            Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)<br/>
            Wildest dreams, ah-ha<br/>
            In your wildest dreams, ah-ha<br/>
            (Even if it's just in your)<br/>
            In your wildest dreams, ah-ha<br/>
            In your wildest dreams, ah-ha<br/>

            <h1>What's in her song?</h1>
            <p>"Wildest Dreams" is about a relationship doomed to end. However, Taylor is not yet ready to let go.<br/>
                Not only is he attractive, but he's masculine and assertive--he's her perfect man.<br/>
                The lyrics explain that while they are still together now, Swift foresees the end of the<br/>
                relationship and hopes that this man won't completely forget her.</p>
