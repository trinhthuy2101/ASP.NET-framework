            <h1>LYRICS</h1>
           <p>'Cause baby now we got bad blood<br/>
            You know it used to be mad love<br/>
            So take a look at what you've done<br/>
            'Cause baby now we got bad blood (hey!)<br/>
            Now we got problems<br/>
            And I don't think we can solve them<br/>
            You made a really deep cut<br/>
            And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)<br/>
            Did you have to do this?<br/>
            I was thinking that you could be trusted<br/>
            Did you have to ruin what was shining now it's all rusted<br/>
            Did you have to hit me where<br/>
            I'm weak, baby, I couldn't breathe<br/>
            I rubbed it in so deep<br/>
            Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me<br/>
            Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times<br/>
            You and I<br/>
            'Cause baby now we got bad blood<br/>
            You know it used to be mad love<br/>
            So take a look at what you've done<br/>
            'Cause baby now we got bad blood (hey!)<br/>
            Now we got problems<br/>
            And I don't think we can solve them<br/>
            You made a really deep cut<br/>
            And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)<br/>
            Did you think we'd be fine?<br/>
            Still got scars on my back from your knife<br/>
            So don't think it's in the past<br/>
            These kind of wounds they last and they last<br/>
            Now did you think it all through?<br/>
            All these things will catch up to you<br/>
            And time can heal but this won't<br/>
            So if you come in my way, just don't<br/>
            Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times<br/>
            You and I<br/>
            'Cause baby now we got bad blood<br/>
            You know it used to be mad love<br/>
            So take a look at what you've done<br/>

            You made a really deep cut<br/>
            And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)<br/>
            Band-aids don't fix bullet holes<br/>
            You say sorry just for show<br/>
            You live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts, ghosts)<br/>
            Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey!)<br/>
            You say sorry just for show (hey!)<br/>
            You live like that, you live with ghosts (hey!)<br/>

            <h1>About this song</h1>
            <p>Taylor said: ""I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person,<br/>
            and I can sleep at night knowing that," she adds. "I knew this song would be assigned to a person and the easiest<br/>
            mark was about someone who I didn't want to be labelled with this song." (Sooo, yeah, probably Katy Perry...)<br/>
            "It was not a song about heartbreak," she concludes. "It was about the loss of friendship. It was important to<br/>
            show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship."
